WOL (Wake-On-LAN)
Copyright 2012 Mario Campos

WOL is a command-line program for executing the Wake-On-LAN protocol over
an ethernet local-area network. It requires a MAC address as an argument.

Included are two programs that both execute WOL:
1) The source for the C program. Must be compiled.
2) The source for the Perl program. Can be executed as is.

The perl script will require Net::Wake and will send an UDP packet. The 
C-based WOL program will broadcast an ethernet frame over the LAN encapsulating
a WOL "Magic Packet" for the intended hibernating computer.

Example: 
	 ./wol 00:11:22:33:44:55
	 ./wol.pl 00:11:22:33:44:55

NOTE: For WOL to work, the intended hibernating target must support and
be configured to listen for Wake-On-LAN packets via its BIOS, NIC or 
what have you.
